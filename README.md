## Open Source PM CMS

Executable Project Operating System

### Privacy-first, self-managed, market-friendly.

Think CI/CD for business ideas. Your project plan must compile before you can launch.

#### 1. Projects-as-Code
Define projects using JSON Schemasâ€”structured, typed, versionable.

#### 2. 12-Step Validation Gates
Progress through guided steps. Can't advance to Step N+1 until Step N validates.

#### 3. Compile-Time Enforcement

- Business logic validated (pricing aligns with value prop)
- Compliance gates enforced (EU projects blocked until DPIA complete)
- Quality scoring (semantic validation, not just "field filled")

#### 4. AI-Assisted, Human-Controlled

- AI suggests best practices at each step
- Multi-pass validation catches hallucinations
- Owner approval required for AI-proposed changes
- Project as a 'Memory' for further details

#### 5. Portable Exports

Compile once, deploy everywhere:

- Git repositories (Markdown + JSON)
- Notion databases
- Jira/ClickUp issues
- One-page documentation

Every export includes provenance: schema version, compile timestamp, validation scores.
